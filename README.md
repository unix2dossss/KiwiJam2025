# String Theory ðŸ§¬

**String Theory** is a split-screen puzzle platformer where two players spawn on opposite ends of the map. They're *connected* by an invisible string - just like the theory suggests. To complete each level, both players must navigate their own worlds and meet in the middle.

#### My Very First Game - Made in 48 Hours for KiwiJam 2025!

The theme of the jam was **"Connections"**, which inspired the idea of two characters tethered by an invisible thread across separate realms.

I built this solo, and itâ€™s my very first real dive into game development. I had no idea how much time programming and debugging would take, but I learned a ton and loved every second of it! 

While I wasnâ€™t able to fully finish the game in time, and some mechanics are still rough around the edges, Iâ€™m really proud of how far it got in just two days.
